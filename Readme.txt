Summary of Learning:
--------------------
This was my first time using SQL, but it was fun and very manageable. I learned how to create databases, define table structures,
insert data, and write queries to manipulate and retrieve information. Working with foreign keys and relationships between tables
was particularly interesting.



Challenges Faced and How They Were Addressed:
---------------------------------------------
1. VPN Connection Issues – The initial setup with the VPN took a long time to resolve, delaying progress on the assignment.

2. Foreign Key Constraints – Encountered issues where adding or removing a table affected another due to dependencies.
   This was resolved by adjusting permissions and ensuring proper order when creating or deleting tables.

3. Overdue Loans and Fines Queries – Initially, the queries for overdue books and associated fines did not return expected results.
   Debugging involved checking filters, testing different WHERE conditions, and ensuring the right data was inserted.



List of SQL Files and Their Contents:
-------------------------------------
• Main Project File: SQL dump of the entire database.

• Task1: Contains the SQL commands for creating the database.

• Task2: Contains the SQL commands for creating tables.

• Task3: Contains the SQL commands for inserting data.

• Task4 - Task7 Folders: Each folder contains three files:

	○ TaskX_Part1.sql – First part of the required queries.

	○ TaskX_Part2.sql – Second part of the required queries.

	○ TaskX_Part3.sql – Third part of the required queries.

• Task8 Folder: Contains two files that were used to create the required tasks.



Database Software Used:
-----------------------
• MariaDB (Accessed via PuTTY)



Additional Input for Grader:
----------------------------
The provided SQL files should be executed in order:

1. Run Task1.sql to create the database.

2. Run Task2.sql to create the necessary tables.

3. Run Task3.sql to insert sample data. (might need extra samples for some of the tasks)

4. Execute Task4 - Task7 queries to generate the required outputs.

5. Finally, run Task8 files to create the views.

✦ The SQL dump file contains all commands if a full import is preferred.
